This project demonstrates a simple blinky application using CMSIS-RTOS Keil
RTX5 and board support API and runs on the Arm Cortex-M4 of an MCB1800 with
100 MHz. The application is CMSIS compliant.

Example functionality:
 - Clock Settings:
   - XTAL    =  12 MHz
   - CPU     = 100 MHz

The simple example simulates a step-motor driver. Four LEDs are blinking
simulating the activation of the four output driver stages:

- phase A
- phase B
- phase C
- phase D

This example simulates Half step driver mode and CW rotation direction.

The target "ULINKplus" is configured for serial wire trace using the
on-board 10-pin Cortex debug connector with a ULINKplus debug adapter running
at 10 MHz. For power measurement, use the 2.55 Ohm shunt (100 mA).

The project is setup to show the following features of µVision debugger:
- Event Recorder
- Event Statistics
- System Analyzer with
  - Power measurement
  - RTOS threads
  - Exceptions

This project demonstrates a simple blinky application with the usage of the
ADC. It uses CMSIS-RTOS Keil RTX5 and board support API and runs on the Arm
Cortex-M4 of an MCB1800 with 100 MHz. The application is CMSIS compliant.

It demonstrates how you can annotate code with the new Event Recorder start
and stop functions to measure time spent and power consumed for certain areas
of the source code.

The target "ULINKplus" is configured for serial wire trace using the
on-board 10-pin Cortex debug connector with a ULINKplus debug adapter running
at 10 MHz. For power measurement, use the 2.55 Ohm shunt (100 mA).

Using the ULINKplus I/O, you can send the device to sleep by connecting IO0 on
the ULINKplus to pin P4_0 on the MCB1800 demo board. Use the toolbox in the
debug session to control the I/O or by pressing the “P4_0” button on the
MCB1800 board.

The project is setup to show the following features of µVision debugger:
- Event Recorder
- Event Statistics
- System Analyzer with power measurement
